# Curriculum
Curriculum for Processing Java Script
These Lessons have been finalized and that version is currently being used to teach programming. 
These Lesson drafts are the material I created and contributed to a greater set of Lessons.

These Lessons are made to be used with the Code Naturally Application, but should work on any application running Processing JavaScript.
The 16 Lessons I have created are made to be a year worth of curriculum for grades 4 - 8. The Lessons are made to be adaptable to different ages and skill levels.
